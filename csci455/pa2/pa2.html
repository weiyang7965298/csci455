<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>

In this assignment you will get practice working with Java arrays,
and more practice implementing your own
classes.  Like you did in assignment 1 and lab 4, you will be
implementing a class whose specification we have given you, in this
case a class called <kbd>SolitaireBoard</kbd>, to represent the board
configuration for a specific type of solitaire game described further below.  You will also be
using tools to help develop correct code, such as <kbd>assert</kbd>
statements along with code to verify that your class implementation is consistent.
<p>
Note: this program is due after your midterm exam, but it's a fair
amount bigger than the first assignment.  We recommend getting started
on it before the midterm.  It only uses topics from before the
midterm, so working on it now will also help you prepare for the exam
(there will be paper and pencil array programming problems as part of the
exam).

statement which you will be "signing" in the README:


<blockquote>
"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, with the exception of the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455

other students in the course."
</blockquote>

</a>


</ul>

<a name="run"><h3>Note on running your program</h3>

We will be using <kbd>assert</kbd> statements in this program.  To be
able to use them, you need to <em>run</em> the program with asserts enabled
(-ea flag).  (You do not need to compile it any special way.)  Here is
an example:

<pre>
java -ea BulgarianSolitaireSimulator
</pre>

You should run with this flag set every time.
<p>
Assert statements, described in Special Topic 11.5 of the text, are another
tool to help us write correct code.  More about how we are using them
here in the section on <a href="#invar">representation invariants</a>.
<p>
NOTE: In Eclipse you use the Run Configurations settings (in the Run
menu) to change what arguments are used when running a program.  We
will be using both <em>program arguments</em> (more details in the
next section) and <em>VM arguments</em> when running this program;
<kbd>-ea</kbd> is a VM argument. (NOTE: VM stands for virtual machine,
as in the Java Virtual Machine, which is what you are running when you
do the "java" command.)
<p>

<a name="assgt"><h3>The assignment</h3>
</a>

You will be implementing a program to model the game Bulgarian
Solitaire.  This program will run in the console window and will not
have a GUI,.  This is problem P7.4 from our textbook Big Java: Early
Objects, 5th Edition, by Cay Horstmann.  Here is his description of
the problem (second paragraph is a paraphrase):

<blockquote>
The game starts with 45 cards.  (They need not be playing cards.
Unmarked index cards work just as well.)  Randomly divide them into
some number of piles of random size.  For example, you might start
with piles of size 20, 5, 1, 9, and 10.  In each round you take one
card from each pile, forming a new pile with these cards.  For
example, the starting configuration would be transformed into piles of
size 19, 4, 8, 9, and 5.  The solitaire is over when the piles have
size 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order.  (It can be shown
that you always end up with such a configuration.)
<p>
In the normal mode of operation your program will produce a random
starting configuration and print it.  It then keeps applying the
solitaire step and printing the results, and stops when the final
configuration is reached.
</blockquote>
<p>
We recommend you finish playing Horstmann's example game, started
above, to see how it comes out (you can do it with just pencil and
paper).  (Save your work because we may be asking for it in lab.)
<p>

To make it easier to test your code, your program will be able to
be run in a few different modes, each of these controlled by a
command-line argument.  The user may supply one or both of the
arguments, or neither.

  <dl>
    <dt><strong><kbd>-u</kbd></strong>
    <dd> Prompts for the initial configuration from the user, instead
    of generating a random configuration.
<p>
  <dt><strong><kbd>-s</kbd></strong>
    <dd> Stops between every round of the game.  The game only
    continues when the user hits enter (a.k.a., return).
 </dl>

Command-line argument processing is discussed in section 11.3 of the
  Horstmann text.  But to make things a little easier, we wrote the
  code for processing the command-line arguments for you.  It appears in
  starter code you get in the <kbd>main</kbd> method in <a
  href="BulgarianSolitaireSimulator.java"><kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator.java</kbd></a>.

Here are a few examples of ways to run the program in the Unix shell:
<pre>
java -ea BulgarianSolitaireSimulator -u
java -ea BulgarianSolitaireSimulator -u -s
java -ea BulgarianSolitaireSimulator
</pre>

[Note: recall we are using the <kbd>-ea</kbd> argument for assertion-checking.
  The arguments after the program name are the ones that get sent to
  your program.]
<p>
There are more details about exactly what your output should look like
in each of these operation modes in the section on the <a href="#prog"><kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator</kbd> program</a>.
<p>
  
Some of the requirements for the program relate to efficiency,
testing, and style/design, as well as functionality.  They are described
in detail in the following sections of the document, and then summarized <a
href="#summary">near the end</a> of the document.

<a name="interface"><h3>SolitaireBoard: interface</h3>

What follows is the specification for the SolitaireBoard class.  You
  must implement the following methods so they work as described: 
<dl>
<dt>
<strong> <kbd>SolitaireBoard()</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Creates a solitaire board with a random initial configuration.
<p>

  <dt>
<strong> <kbd>SolitaireBoard(String numberString)</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Creates a solitaire board with the given configuration.  The format of
  the string is a space-separated list of integers.  Example
  string: "20 5 1 9 10".  <br> Precondition:
  <kbd>SolitaireBoard.isValidConfigString(numberString)</kbd> is true
  <br> More about this in the section on <a href="#validString" >valid
  configuration strings</a>.

<p>
<dt>
<strong><kbd>void playRound()</kbd></strong>
<dd>
      Plays one round of Bulgarian solitaire.  Updates the configuration according to the rules
      of Bulgarian solitaire: Takes one card from each pile, and puts them all together in a new pile.
      The old piles that are left will be in the same relative order as before, 
      and the new pile will be at the end.
<p>

<dt>
<strong><kbd> boolean isDone()</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Returns true iff the current board is at the end of the game.  That is, there are <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd>
piles that are of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd> in any order.
<p>

<dt>
<strong><kbd>String configString()</kbd></strong>

<dd> Returns current board configuration as a string with the format of
      a space-separated list of numbers with <em>no leading or trailing spaces</em>.
      The numbers represent the number of cards in each non-empty
      pile.  Example return string: "20 5 1 9 10"
  </dd>
<p>
<dt>
<strong><kbd>static boolean isValidConfigString(String configString)</kbd></strong>
  
  <dd> Returns true iff <kbd>configString</kbd> is a space-separated list of numbers that
      represents a valid Bulgarian solitaire board, assuming the card total
      <kbd>SolitaireBoard.CARD_TOTAL</kbd>.  Note this is a static method: it
      only operates on its explicit <kbd>String</kbd> argument; no implicit
      object instance involved.  More about this in the <a
      href="#validString" >following section</a>.
    <br>

</dl>
<p>

In addition, we have defined two public named constants for you:
<dl>
 <dt>
<kbd><strong>static final int CARD_TOTAL</kbd></strong>
<dt>
  <kbd><strong>static final int NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd></strong>
<dd>
We have defined two public named constants for you,
  <kbd>CARD_TOTAL</kbd> (45) and <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd> (9).
  Please write all of your code in terms of these constants, so that
  your program will still work if their values are changed.  You
  should also test your code with different values for
  NUM_FINAL_PILES.  For games that will terminate, the sum of the numbers
  from 1 to <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd> must equal <kbd>CARD_TOTAL</kbd>, so we have set
  <kbd>CARD_TOTAL</kbd> to be a value computed from
  <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd>.  So, for example, if you
  change  <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd> to 4, <kbd>CARD_TOTAL</kbd> will automatically have the value 10.  See
  comments in <a href="SolitaireBoard.java"><kbd>SolitaireBoard.java</kbd></a> for more details.

</dl>

Note: No <kbd>SolitaireBoard</kbd> methods do any I/O.
<p>

You may have noticed that there is another method,
<kbd>isValidSolitaireBoard</kbd>, that's <kbd>private</kbd> , i.e., not part of
the public interface.  We will describe that <a
 href="#invar">later</a> after we discuss the representation.
<p> 

You may not change the public interface for this class, with the following
exception: you may add a public <kbd>SolitaireBoard</kbd> <kbd>toString</kbd>
method that you may want to use for debugging purposes.  It would
be very short and mostly consist of call to the <kbd>toString</kbd> method(s) of its
constituent part(s).  That way you can see if you are building your
<kbd>SolitaireBord</kbd> object correctly, even before you implement
<kbd>configString</kbd>.  Section 9.5.1 of the textbook has more about
writing a <kbd>toString</kbd> method.  Hint: to get a String
representation of an array, use <kbd>Arrays.toString</kbd>
<p>

<a name="validString">
<h3>More about <kbd>isValidConfigString</kbd></h3>
</a>
So, why does the String version of the SolitaireBoard constructor have
a precondition, when the code to check that precondition is part of
the class itself?  It's because constructors have no return values, so we have
no way to return an error code if the client gives invalid data to the
constructor.  There is another way to get around this, namely
Java Exceptions, but we won't get to them until later in the semester.  So,
instead, your client code (i.e., in
<kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator</kbd>) can call
<kbd>isValidConfigString</kbd> to check whether the string is valid
before you create a SolitaireBoard with that data.  We'll discuss this
method further in a <a href="#relation">later section</a>; but it
won't make sense until we discuss the representation we're using.
<p>

<a name="impl"><h3>SolitaireBoard: representation/implementation</h3>
</a>
For the purposes of this assignment you are required to use an array
to represent the piles of cards in your solitaire board (each array
element is one pile).  <strong>You may have additional fields, but you may not
use an <kbd>ArrayList</kbd></strong>.  This is going to be a partially-filled
array.  However, different from other situations where the number of
elements in an array can change size, in this application there is an
upper bound on the number of elements, so if you allocate your array
in the constructor using that upper bound, you'll never have to resize
it later.  You'll figure out what that upper bound is once you think
about the problem a little.
<p>

<a name="invar"><h3>Representation invariants</h3>

Many of the development techniques we discuss in this class, for
example, incremental development, the use of good variable names, and
unit-testing, are to help enable us to write correct code (and make it
easier to enhance that code later).  Another way to ensure correct
code within a class is to make explicit any restrictions on what
values are allowed to be in a private instance variable, and any
restrictions on relationships between values in different instances
variables in our object.  Or put another way, making sure we know what
must be true about our object representation when it is in a valid
state.  These are called <em>representation invariants</em>.
<p>

Representation invariants are things that are
true about the object as viewed by the implementor.  Since for many
classes, once a constructor has been called the other methods can be
called in any order, we need to ensure that none of the constructors
or mutators can leave the object in an invalid state.  It will be
easier to do that if we know what those assumptions are.
<p>

There are two assignment requirements for your SolitaireBoard class related to
this issue (detailed explanations of each of these follow):

<ol>

<li> in a comment just above or below your private instance variable definitions for SolitaireBoard,
list the representation invariants for the object.  

<li> write the private <kbd>boolean</kbd> method <kbd>isValidSolitaireBoard()</kbd> and
call it from other places in your program as described below.

</ol>

<strong>The representation invariant comment for <kbd>SolitaireBoard</kbd></strong>

<br>

Write a list of all the conditions that the internals of a
SolitaireBoard object must satisfy.  That is, conditions that are
always true about the data in a valid SolitaireBoard object.  For
example, one or more invariants would describe where the data is in a
partially filled array (we did a similar example in lecture on 2/9).
Another one (or more) would be related to the restriction that there
are always <kbd>CARD_TOTAL</kbd> cards on the board.
<p>

<a name="valid"></a> <strong><kbd>isValidSolitaireBoard()</kbd>
method</strong>

<br> 

This private method will test the representation invariant for the
internals of a solitaire board.  It will return true iff it is valid, i.e., the
invariants are satisfied.

<p>
Call this function at the end of every public SolitaireBoard method,
including the constructors, to make
sure the method leaves the board
in the correct state.  This is one kind of sanity check: one part of a
program double-checking that another part is doing the right thing (similar
to printing expected results and actual results).  Note: this only
applies to non-static methods.  SolitaireBoard also has one public
static method -- you won't be able to call isValidSolitaireBoard
there since there is no object to check.
<p>

Rather than putting this test in an if statement, we're going to put
it in an <kbd>assert</kbd> statement.  For example:

<pre>
assert isValidSolitaireBoard();      // calls isSolitaireBoard on implicit parameter
</pre>

  Assert statements are described
in Special topic 11.5 of the text.
<p>

Please make sure you are running your program with assertions enabled
for every run of this program, since it's in a development stage.  See
earlier <a href="#run">section</a> for how to do this.

You won't really know if they are getting checked unless you
force one to fail.
<p>

The point of these assert statements is to notify you in no uncertain
terms of possible bugs in your code.  The program
crashing will force you to fix those bugs.  For example, if a board
doesn't have <kbd>CARD_TOTAL</kbd> (45) cards on it, then the simulation may never
terminate, or if the array has "hole" in the middle, then other
methods, such as <kbd>configString</kbd> may not work as advertised.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="relation"></a> Relationship between <kbd>isValidSolitaireBoard</kbd>
method and <kbd>isValidConfigString</kbd> method</h3>
</strong>
<p>

So, we've determined a client (e.g.,
<kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator</kbd> code) can check whether their
String represents a valid solitaire configuration by calling the public
static method <kbd>isValidConfigString</kbd> (that was described
further <a href="#validString" >here</a>).  And we've said that the
implementation of <kbd>SolitaireBoard</kbd> will need to call the
private method <kbd>isValidSolitaireBoard</kbd> to verify that our
class does not violate our representation invariants when we call
methods on it (that was described further in the previous section).
But it seems like these two methods are doing the same checks, right?
Yes, pretty much.
<p>

Furthermore, we can structure our code so we don't have to write the
code for this check more than once.  We'll give you some hints on how
to do so here; it's a little confusing, because it involves both
static and non-static methods.  <strong>You are not required to employ
the code reuse here</strong> but I would expect more advanced
students to do so.  In fact, you may want to skip this section for
now, and come back to it once
you are well into your design and coding for the
assignment.  
<p>

So, to continue, to reuse the code to check if it's a valid
configuration involves factoring out the
common code into a third method, like we did when we created
<kbd>lookupLoc</kbd> to help us write <kbd>insert</kbd> and
<kbd>remove</kbd> for the <kbd>Names</kbd> class we developed in
recent lectures.
<p>
But because one of the methods here is static, it means this third method
will also need to be static.  It would take a partially-filled array
version of the configuration as its two parameters; it might have the
following header:

<pre>
private static boolean isValidConfiguration(int[] piles, int numPiles)
</pre>

So, the non-static method <kbd>isValidSolitaireBoard</kbd> would just
call this new method, using its instance variables as the actual
parameters in the call to isValidConfiguration.  Since
isValidConfiguration
is static, it can't access the instance
variables directly.
<p>

And the static method <kbd>isValidConfigString</kbd> would convert its string to
a partially-filled array of integers version, and then call <kbd>isValidConfiguration</kbd>
to do the actual check.
<p>

A small downside to this organization is that at run time the string
will end up getting converted to the array representation twice, once
when the client checks if its a valid representation, and then again
in the SolitaireBoard constructor -- but this is a one-time matter at
object creation time.  But you don't have to
<em>write</em> that conversion code twice: you can do the same trick
again: make another private static method to do the conversion, and
then call it in both places.  (Hint: to return two values from a Java
method as would be necessary here, one of them can be the actual
return value, and the other can be an updated array.  This works because array
parameters (like objects) are passed as references.  (See Special
topic 8.1 for more on Java parameter passing.))

<p>

<a name="prog"><h3><kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator</kbd> program</h3>
</a>

Please take a look at this example for what your output must look like.
This shows (part of) a run of
the program with the <strong><kbd>-u</kbd></strong> option turned on.  It also
illustrates the error-checking.  User input is shown in bold.

<pre>
Number of total cards is 45
You will be entering the initial configuration of the cards (i.e., how many in each pile).
Please enter a space-separated list of positive integers followed by newline:
<strong>40 1 1 1 1</strong>
ERROR: Each pile must have at least one card and the total number of cards must be 45
Please enter a space-separated list of positive integers followed by newline:
<strong>44 b 1 x</strong>
ERROR: Each pile must have at least one card and the total number of
cards must be 45
Please enter a space-separated list of positive integers followed by newline:
<strong>100 -55</strong>
ERROR: Each pile must have at least one card and the total number of cards must be 45
Please enter a space-separated list of positive integers followed by newline:
<strong>0 45</strong>
ERROR: Each pile must have at least one card and the total number of cards must be 45
Please enter a space-separated list of positive integers followed by newline:
<strong>40 1 1 1 1 1</strong>
Initial configuration: 40 1 1 1 1 1
[1] Current configuration: 39 6
[2] Current configuration: 38 5 2
[3] Current configuration: 37 4 1 3
. . .
[30] Current configuration: 10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
[31] Current configuration: 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Done!
</pre>

Here is an example of what your output should look like with the
<strong><kbd>-s</kbd></strong> option turned on (the -u option is not set in this
example, so it uses a random initial configuration).  Again, only part
of the run is shown here.  After each
"&lt;Type return...&gt;" the program blocks until the user hits the return
key.

<pre>
Initial configuration: 9 4 6 26
[1] Current configuration: 8 3 5 25 4
&lt;Type return to continue&gt;
[2] Current configuration: 7 2 4 24 3 5
&lt;Type return to continue&gt;
[3] Current configuration: 6 1 3 23 2 4 6
&lt;Type return to continue&gt;
. . .
[26] Current configuration: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10
&lt;Type return to continue&gt;
[27] Current configuration: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 8
&lt;Type return to continue&gt;
Done!
</pre>

If <em>neither</em> argument is set, then the program will take no user input,
and just show the initial configuration followed by the numbered result of each round until it finishes
(i.e., output like the second example above, but without the lines
that say "&lt;Type return...&gt;").
<p>

A correct program will always terminate.  For some values of <kbd>SolitaireBoard.CARD_TOTAL</kbd> 
a game won't terminate; so do not change the code that sets this value
based on the current value of
<kbd>SolitaireBoard.NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd> (the code to do that is already present
in the starter version); this way it should still terminate even if you
change <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd> to some other positive value.
<p>

<strong>
Your output for a particular input should match what's shown above
character-by-character</strong> (e.g., the messages displayed and the
error handling should be the same), so we can automate our tests when
we grade your program.  This means the new piles must appear in the
particular order shown, not only in how they are printed, but the order
of the numbers in the <kbd>String</kbd> returned by the
<kbd>SolitaireBoard</kbd>'s <kbd>configString</kbd> method.


<p>

<a name="error"><h3>Error checking required</h3>

You are required to check that the list of numbers entered are
actually all numbers (integers) and represents a valid
configuration.  You will put the code to do these checks in
<kbd>SolitaireBoard</kbd>'s boolean static method
<kbd>SolitaireBoard.isValidConfigString</kbd>.  That method doesn't do
any I/O itself: you will be calling it from your <kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator</kbd>.
The first examples in the previous section shows the error message you
should print for an invalid configuration.

<a name="lineinput"><h3>Converting a String into an array of numbers</h3>

In user mode, you will not be able to read in the numbers directly
into an array of ints using repeated calls to <kbd>nextInt</kbd>,
because we're using newline as a delimiter (i.e., a signal that that's
the end of the input data), and <kbd>nextInt</kbd> skips over (as in,
doesn't stop for) newlines.  Also if you look at the interface for
SolitaireBoard, you'll see that there is no constructor to create one
from an array of numbers, but there is one that takes a String.  So you'll want
to read the input all at once using the <kbd>Scanner</kbd>
<kbd>nextLine</kbd> method, and the conversion to an array of ints
will actually happen in the <kbd>SolitaireBoard</kbd> class.
(<kbd>SolitaireBoard.isValidConfigString</kbd> will also probably need
to do this conversion.  <a href="#relation" >This section</a> has more
about reusing the same code for these in both places.)
<p>

How do we do such a conversion?  
Section 11.2.5 of the textbook (called Scanning a String) shows one
way of solving the problem of processing an indeterminate number of
values all on one line.
It takes advantage of the fact that the
<kbd>Scanner</kbd> class can also be used to read from a
<kbd>String</kbd> instead of the keyboard.  Once we have our String of
ints from the call to <kbd>nextLine()</kbd>, you
create a <em>second</em> <kbd>Scanner</kbd> object initialized with this
string to then break up the line into the parts you want, using the
Scanner methods you are already familiar with.
<p>

<a name="struct"><h3>Structure of <kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator</kbd></h3>

The code for <kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator</kbd> is too long
to be readable if you put it all
into the <kbd>main</kbd> method.  We could design and add another
class, to deal with the simulation, but instead we'll use a procedural
design to organize the code; we'll review procedural design here.
<p>

A good design principle (for procedural as well as object-oriented
programming) is to keep each of your methods small, for easier
program readability.  In object-oriented programming, the class design
sometimes naturally results in small methods, but sometimes you still
need auxiliary private methods.
The same principles apply for
a procedural design.  Since we haven't given you a predefined method
decomposition for the <kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator</kbd>, you will have to create
this decomposition yourself.
<p>

A procedural design in Java is just implemented as <kbd>static</kbd>
methods in Java that pass data around via explicit parameters.  Static
methods are discussed in Section 8.4 of the text, and this use of them
was also discussed in a <a href="../../labs/lab4/lab4.html#static"
>sidebar in Lab 4</a>.  We have seen
several examples of this in other test programs we have written, for
example <a href="../pa1/ImPointTester.java"><kbd>ImPointTester.java</kbd></a> of PA1,
<a
href="../../labs/lab4/NumsTester.java"><kbd>NumsTester.java</kbd></a>
of lab 4, and 
<kbd>PartialNamesTester.java</kbd>
we developed in lecture.  We have also seen some utility classes in
Java that have static methods: <kbd>Math</kbd> and <kbd>Arrays</kbd>.

<p>
If you have learned about procedural design in other
programming classes, you know that global variables are a no-no.
Thus, in designing such a "main program" class, we don't create any
class-level variables, because they become effectively global
variables (see also <a href="../style.html" target="_blank">Style
Guideline</a> #9).  The "main class" does not represent any overall
object.  Instead you will create variables <em>local</em> to
<kbd>main</kbd> that will get passed to (or returned from) its helper
methods, as necessary.  <p> Note: the next section discusses a limit
on method length as one of our style guidelines for this course.
<p>


Another design issue that comes up often, and that we have discussed
in lecture: it's desirable to employ code
reuse where appropriate.
In particular, for this assignment, if there are 4
possible modes in which the program can be run (i.e., two flags that
can be turned on and off independently), a good solution would
<em>not</em> repeat the same code 4 times!  Imagine, adding two more
options, then we'd have to have it repeated 16 times!
<p>
As we've discussed in lecture: one clue is if you find yourself
writing the same or similar code sequence multiple times, it may be an
indication that there's a better (and shorter) way to do it.

<a name="summary"><h3>Summary of requirements</h3>

As on the first assignment, there are several requirements for this
assignment related to design, testing, and development process strewn
throughout this document.  We'll summarize those and the functional
requirements here:

<ul>

<li> implement SolitaireBoard class according its public interface (see <a
href="#interface">SolitaireBoard: interface</a>)

<li> use the representation for SolitaireBoard described in the
section <a href="#impl">about that</a>.

<li> write <a href="#invar">representation invariant</a> comments for
SolitaireBoard class.

<li> implement and use private SolitaireBoard method <kbd>isValidSolitaireBoard</kbd> as described 
<a href="#valid">here</a>.

<li> implement BulgarianSolitaireSimulator with the user interface described in the section
about the <a href="#prog">BulgarianSolitaireSimulator program</a>.

<li> do the error checking described in the <a href="#error" >Error
  Checking section</a>.

<li> your code will also be evaluated on style, documentation, and design.
We will deduct points for programs that do not follow the published <a
 href="../style.html" >style guidelines</a> for this course (they are
also linked from the Assignments page).  (Note: For pa1 we only
deducted points for problems related to <em>some</em> of the style
guidelines.)  One guideline we want you to be especially aware of is the limit of 30
lines of code at most allowable in a method.  This is exclusive of
whitespace, comment lines, and lines that just have a curly bracket by
itself (i.e., you should not sacrifice code-readability to make your
code fit into this limit).  Hopefully, it's obvious that putting
  multiple statements or declarations on a single line decreases code
  readability and is not desirable; that would also result a loss in style
  points.
  <p>
  For these "style" points we will also take into account the general quality of
  your design (e.g., see hints in the previous section).  

<p>

</ul>

<a name="extra"><h3>Extra credit</h3>

We won't be discussing big-O until nearer the due date, so I'm making
this one part extra credit:  You will receive a small amount of extra
credit if your <kbd>playRound</kbd> and <kbd>isDone</kbd> methods execute in time linear in
the number of piles (i.e., O(<em>n</em>)) and if your <kbd>playRound</kbd> uses
a constant amount of extra space (e.g., it does not allocate a new array).
However, your <kbd>isDone</kbd>
method may use more space to meet the O(<em>n</em>) time requirement.
<p>

<a name="submit"><h3>README file / Submitting your program</h3>

You will be submitting <kbd>SolitaireBoard.java</kbd>, <kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator.java</kbd>, and
<kbd>README</kbd>.  Make sure your name and loginid appear at the
start of each file.
<p>
Here's a review of what goes in the README:  This is the place to
document known bugs in your program. That means you should describe
thoroughly any test cases that fail for the the program you are
submitting.  (You do not need to include a history of the bugs you
already fixed.)  You also use the README to give the grader any other
special information, such as if there is some special way to compile
or run your program.  You will also be signing the <a href="#certification" >certification</a> 
shown near the top of this document.
<p>
Like last time, for your convenience we put the exact submit command
to use in a shell script.  There should be a copy of this script in
your aludra directory that has all your source code files in it (it
was one of the original files you copied from our assignment
directory), and you can run it as follows:

<pre>
source turninpa2
</pre>

(It's just a text file, so you can look at
its <a href="turninpa2">contents</a> to see the submit command it will run.)
